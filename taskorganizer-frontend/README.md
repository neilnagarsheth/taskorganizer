# Frontend

Uses [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) using Typescript.
Uses [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for the frontend CSS framework

A lot of the code is still using the head-start code provided by Angular's tour of heroes.

To install:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), min version 4.x.x and npm 3.x.x 
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start

The frontend is run on a lite server.  All changes in html/css/typescript files reflect immediately when they are made.
